## Crawl cases and save to file
The purpose of this project is to crawl various government websites and collect COVID-19 testing data. This will hopefully aid in quantifying and comparing responses between countries.

## Data
Currently is available for the following countries/states. 

## Spiders
Currently spiders are available for the following countries/states. This is not neccessarily the same the above table because some data is collected manually.
